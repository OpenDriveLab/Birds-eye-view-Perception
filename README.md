## Introduction

This repo is associated with the survey paper "[Delving into the Devils of Birdâ€™s-eye-view Perception: A Review, Evaluation and Recipe](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10321736)", which provides an up-to-date literature survey for BEV perception and an open-source BEV toolbox based on PyTorch. We also introduce the BEV algorithm family, including follow-up work on BEV percepton such as [VCD](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15670), [GAPretrain](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03105), and [FocalDistiller](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/html/Zeng_Distilling_Focal_Knowledge_From_Imperfect_Expert_for_3D_Object_Detection_CVPR_2023_paper.html). We hope this repo can not only be a good starting point for new beginners but also help current researchers in the BEV perception community.
<!-- In the literature survey, it includes different modalities (camera, lidar and fusion) and tasks (detection and segmentation). As for the toolbox, it provides useful recipe for BEV camera-based 3D object detection, including solid data augmentation strategies, efficient BEV encoder design, loss function family, useful test-time augmentation, ensemble policy, and so on. -->

### Major Features

* **Up-to-date Literature Survey for BEV Perception** <br> We summarize important methods in recent years about BEV perception, including different modalities (camera, LIDAR, Fusion) and tasks (Detection, Segmentation, Occupancy). More details of the survey paper list can be found [here](./docs/paper_list/).

* **Convenient BEVPerception Toolbox** <br> We integrate a bag of tricks in the BEV toolbox that helps us achieve 1st in the camera-based detection track of the Waymo Open Challenge 2022, which can be used independently or as a plug-in for popular deep learning libraries. Moreover, we provide a suitable playground for beginners in this area, including a hands-on tutorial and a small-scale dataset (1/5 WOD in kitti format) to validate ideas. More details can be found [here](./bev_toolbox/README.md).

* **SOTA BEV Knowledge Distillation Algorithms** <br> We include important follow-up works of BEVFormer/BEVDepth/SOLOFusion in the perspective of knowledge distillation([VCD](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15670), [GAPretrain](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03105), [FocalDistiller](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/html/Zeng_Distilling_Focal_Knowledge_From_Imperfect_Expert_for_3D_Object_Detection_CVPR_2023_paper.html)). More details of each paper can be found in each README.md file under [here](./nuScenes_playground/).

## Literature Survey

![](figs/general_overview.png)
The general picture of BEV perception at a glance, where consists of three sub-parts based on the input modality. BEV perception is a general task built on top of a series of fundamental tasks. For better completeness of the whole perception algorithms in autonomous driving, we list other topics as well. More details can be found in the [survey paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10321736).

We have summarized important datasets and methods in recent years about BEV perception in academia and also different roadmaps used in industry.
